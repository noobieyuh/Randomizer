## What is Randomizer?
It's what you thought at first, it's a random number generator (1,6). The program is just like rolling a dice.

## What do I do?
You click the roll button, and a window will pop up with what number you got!

There are sound effects and audio that plays depending on your roll.

## Have Fun!
